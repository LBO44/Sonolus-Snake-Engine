# sonolus Snake Engine 

My attempt at making a basic snake game for [Sonolus](https://sonolus.com/) (WIP).

If you really want to try out this buggy snake game, you can add the following server url in the Sonolus app: https://lbo44.github.io/Sonolus-Snake-Engine (opening that link in a browser won't work) or you can directly click on [this link](https://open.sonolus.com/lbo44.github.io/Sonolus-Snake-Engine).

### Things I should probably do:
- [ ] find good sfx
- [ ] replay mode (I have no clue how)
    - [ ] properly load the movement data
    - [ ] load the apples in the correct order
    - [ ] draw the whole snake body
    - [ ] add progress bar to allow jumping to any time of the replay
- [ ] improve visuals
    - [ ] fix death animation
    - [ ] screen shake/vibration
    - [x] make the eyes randomly blink
    - [ ] apple eating animation
- [ ] tutorial mode (maybe?)
- [ ] ~~create a very basic static website~~
- [ ] host an actual server
    - [ ] support uploading replays
    - [ ] add leaderboards
