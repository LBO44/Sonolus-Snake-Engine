# sonolus Snake Engine 

An attempt at making a basic snake game in [Sonolus](https://sonolus.com/) (WIP).

### Things I will probably do:
    -[ ] find sfx
    -[ ] replay mode (I have no clue how)
    -[ ] improve visuals
        -[ ] fix death animation
        -[ ] screen shake/vibration
        -[x] make the eyes randomly blink
        -[ ] apple eating animation
    -[ ] tutorial mode (maybe?)
