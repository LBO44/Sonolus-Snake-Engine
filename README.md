# sonolus Snake Engine 

An attempt at making a basic snake game in [Sonolus](https://sonolus.com/) (WIP).

If you really want to try out this buggy snake game you add the following server url in Sonolus: https://lbo44.github.io/Sonolus-Snake-Engine (note that visiting the link directly in a browser won't work).

### Things I will probably do:
- [ ] find sfx
- [ ] replay mode (I have no clue how)
- [ ] improve visuals
    - [ ] fix death animation
    - [ ] screen shake/vibration
    - [x] make the eyes randomly blink
    - [ ] apple eating animation
- [ ] tutorial mode (maybe?)
- [ ] create a very basic static website (very unlikely)
